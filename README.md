# Whack-A-Pede

## Summary

Whack-A-Pede is a quasi mash-up of the Atari arcade classic, Centipede, and Whack-A-Mole, the popular arcade game by Bandai for suitable Android phones and tablets.  While borrowing elements reminiscent of both games, Whack-A-Pede is a vastly different gaming experience.

## Installation Instructions

### During Testing

- To run on an appropriate Android Studio phone or tablet emulator, open the project with Android Studio, select the desired emulator from the dropdown, and then click run.

- To run on a compatible hardware Android phone or tablet, make the provided APK file accessible via an email or file sharing account you can access from your device, open the APK from your device, and follow the on screen prompts.

### After Release

- From a compatible hardware Android phone or tablet, open the Google Play Store, search for Whack-A-Pede, and follow the Google Play Store prompts to install it.  Alternatively, go to [this future link](https://www.google.com/whackapede) which will navigate to Whack-A-Pede in the Google Play Store.

## Hardware Requirements

- Android phones and tablets running Android 5.0 (API 21) or later are required.

- Android phones and tablets running Android 7.0 (API 24) are recommended for best graphical performance.

- Android phones and tablets running Android 5.0 or 6.0 (API 21 or 23) introduce artifacts when rendering some of the transparency effects.  It is unknown if this is limited to emulators or applies to hardware devices, too.

- A physical device is recommended for testing the game screen itself.  Emulators introduce delays that can affect the correct animation of on-screen elements at higher speeds, but any compatible emulator is fine to test the overall navigation and other app features.

- The most recent version of Google Play Services should be installed on the emulator or physical device.

### Hardware and Emulators Tested On

- Nexus 5 Emulator, Android 5.0 through 10.0 (API 21 through 29).

- Nexus 9 and Pixel C Emulator, Android 7.0 (API 27).
