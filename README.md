# Whack-A-Pede

## Summary

Whack-A-Pede is a quasi mash-up of the Atari arcade classic, Centipede, and Whack-A-Mole, the popular arcade game by Bandai for suitable Android phones and tablets.  While borrowing elements reminiscent of both games, Whack-A-Pede is a vastly different gaming experience.
